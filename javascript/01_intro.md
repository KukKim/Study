# 1. Javascript Intro  


### 1. What is javascript?
Javascript is lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class-functions. And javascript is a protype-based, multi-paradigm, single-thread, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles.

#### Keywords
- Just-in-time : In computing, just-in-time (JIT) compilation (also dynamic translation or run-time compilations) is a way of executing computer code that involves compilation during execution of a program (at run time) rather than before execution.
- prototype-based : Prototype-based programming is a style of object-oriented programming in which classes are not explicitly defined, but rather derived by adding properties and methods to an instance of another class or, less frequently, adding them to an empty object.
- dynamic typing : Dynamically-typed languages are those (like JavaScript) where the interpreter assigns variables a type at runtime based on the variable's value at the time.
