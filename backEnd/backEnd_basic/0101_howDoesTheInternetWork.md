# 1-1. How dowes the Internet work?
The internet is a technology infrastructure that connects billions of computers.(The Internet is infrastructure, and services built on the Internet are called the Web.)  
The Internet is made up of a computer-to-computer connection. But there are so many computers in the world that you need a special way to connect countless computers.

## Router  
Router is a device that transmits and receives data between computers. Routers can simplify connections between multiple computers, as shown below.

Router connects multiple computers to ensure that packets reach the correct destination. To identify the destination of the packet, we need the destination address, and we use the IP address for this.

## ISP
ISP stands for Internet Service Provider. The company that we often pay to provide Internet services is called ISP. ISPs not only maintain connectivity with our computers, but also with other ISPs in the world, allowing our computers to connect to servers on the other side of the globe.
