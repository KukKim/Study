Application Layer (7) - Human-computer Interaction layer, where applications can access the network services  
Presentation Layer (6) - Ensures that data is in a usable format and it where data encryption occurs  
Session Layer (5) - Maintains connections and is responsible for controlling ports and sesisons  
Transport Layer (4) - Transmits data using transmission protocols including TCP and UDP  
Network Layer (3) - Decides whitch physical path the data will take  
Data Link Layer (2) - Defines the format of data on the network  
Physical Layer (1) - Transmits row bit stream over the physical midium
